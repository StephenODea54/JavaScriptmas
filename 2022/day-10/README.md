# Sort By Length

Given an array of strings, sort them in the order of increasing lengths. If two strings have the same length, their relative order must be the same as in the initial array.

## Example
```js
const inputArray = ['abc', '', 'aaa', 'a', 'zz'];
const result = sortByLength(inputArray);
console.log(result); // ['', 'a', 'zz', 'abc', 'aaa]
```

The answer is in the first part of `main.js`.
